The Multi-view application can be launched manually using `/usr/bin/com.webos.app.multiview`.


At least on my TV multiview doesn't seem to be officially supported anywhere in the UI. Yet still - it can be launched via telnet when rooted: /usr/bin/com.webos.app.multiview. This can possibly be wrapped in a proper app.
