# RootMy.TV (webOS 3.5+)

[RootMy.TV](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rootmy-tv-coming-soon-developer-pre-release-available-now.4232223/) is a webOS exploit discovered by Retr0id that targets devices running webOS 3.5x+.

The payload takes advantage of an additional permission that LG official apps have, which allows them to call DownloadManager in a privileged mode where it is allowed to download files to any location of the system.
